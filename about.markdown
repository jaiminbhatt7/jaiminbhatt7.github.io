## Hello, I'm Jaimin

I'm a writer, traveller, and amateur photographer based in Seattle. I spend as much time as I can outdoors — on foot, in the mountains, along coastlines, or wherever a long drive leads me on a free weekend.

RefrainPlain started as a personal notebook and eventually became a blog. The name reflects the way landscapes repeat themselves in memory: the same ridge silhouette at dusk, the same bend in a river, the same stillness before a storm breaks. Paying attention to those repetitions is how I travel.

## What you'll find here

**RefrainPlain** is a blog about nature, travel, and photography. Posts range from trail reports and destination guides to longer essays about the practice of slow travel and the challenge of capturing a moment in an image. I am not interested in superlatives — the "most spectacular" or the "most remote." I am more interested in what it feels like to be somewhere specific, in a specific light, with a specific quality of attention.

Photography appears in almost every post, shot on whatever I happened to have with me at the time. I am not a professional, and I do not pretend to be.
