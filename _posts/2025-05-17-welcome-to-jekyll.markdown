excerpt: "RefrainPlain is a space for slow travel, wild landscapes, and the quiet art of paying attention — where every journey becomes a story worth telling."

There is a particular kind of stillness you find only when you are far from where you started. Not silence exactly — the mountains are never truly silent — but a quality of attention that sharpens when familiar noise falls away. That feeling is what RefrainPlain is about.

This blog grew out of years of wandering: early mornings on high ridgelines, afternoons lost in coastal towns, evenings watching light dissolve over plains I had no name for. I kept notes, kept photographs, kept trying to find the right words for things that resisted easy description. RefrainPlain is where those efforts finally have a home.

The name has a double life. It was first the hostname of my developer machine at Yahoo — the name assigned to the box I wrote my earliest code on. I spent long hours in front of that machine, but my mind was always somewhere else: out on a trail, on a coastline, in the mountains I was planning to visit on the next long weekend. When I eventually started this blog, the name came back to me, and it fit in ways I hadn't anticipated. The refrain — the repeated phrase in a song or poem — is exactly what landscapes do: a ridge silhouetted at dusk looks like the ridge you saw three valleys back, a river bends the same way rivers always bend. "Plain" in the sense of open, unadorned, unhurried. The machine is long gone, but the name stuck.

You will find posts here about specific places — trails and coastlines, mountain huts and border towns — alongside essays about the practice of travel itself: how to slow down, how to look, how to come home changed. Photography is threaded through everything, because some moments ask to be held in an image before they can be held in words.

I am glad you found this corner of the internet. Pull up a chair, browse the archive, and feel free to reach out if a post strikes a chord. The best journeys are the ones shared, even after the fact.
